Hey there! 🍉 This is a sample subtitle. 👈
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.300
This sub title is a bit longer and demonstrates the ability to render longer content onto multiple lines. It is good to have examples of this where there is a lot of content.
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can continue to test how these subtitles might look
00:00:30.500 --> 00:01:30.000
This last subtitle will last until one minute and thirty seconds have passed in the video
