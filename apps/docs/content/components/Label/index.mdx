## Usage

Use labels to indicate the status of an item or to help oraganize and categorize them. E.g, using "New" or "Recommended". Labels aren't meant to be used as interactive elements. Instead use the [Button](/components/Button) component.

      Don't use labels as an interactive or navigational element. Use a button
      or a link component.

Position the labels to clearly identify the object they’re informing.

      Give labels enough space to be clearly identified. Use size or color to
      differentiate them if needed.

### Content

Use Label with with short, scannable text. If possible, use a single word to describe the status of an object. Use two or more words if you need to describe a complex state or category. For example, “Limited availability" or "Enterprise only".

## Options

### Size

Labels come in two sizes: `medium`, and `large`.

### Medium

Use the `medium` size when paired with medium-sized headings or in components such as `Card`.

<Container
  display="grid"
  gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', null, null, null, '1fr 1fr']}
  gridGap={5}
>
  <div>
    <img
      src="https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/02d09a61-1d19-49ed-8a6a-7a1338783dd4"
      alt=""
    />
    <Caption>
      The Card component allows for a medium label to provide extra meta data to
      the content. In a group of stacked cards, the label helps to quickly scan
      certain items.

    />
    <Caption>
      Medium labels are great for headings that introduce a section. They help
      categorize the main topic and provide a visual break.

  </div>
</Container>

### Large

Use the `large` size when paired with large headings, such as in the `Hero` component.

<div>
  <img
    src="https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/7a0da376-5457-4ced-aa78-8157ed8c20c1"
    alt=""
  />
  <Caption>
    Use large labels with headings that introduce a page. Use it to introduce
    the main topic or application.
  </Caption>
</div>

### Color

The label offers color options from the [Primer Brand color palette](/primitives/color). These color choices are carefully curated to ensure optimal contrast with the background or surrounding elements. Colors options doesn't follow a strict functional meaning. We recommend using the colors that best fit the context of your application. For example, blue and purple gradient for `Copilot` examples.

### Leading visual

You can add a leading icon to enhance the visual context. It is recommended you use an [Octicon](https://primer.style/octicons). Use an icon that reinforces the meaning of the label. For example, a `StarIcon` for a "Starred" label.
