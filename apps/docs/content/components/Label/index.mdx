## Usage

Use labels to indicate the status of an item or to help oraganize and categorize them. Labels aren't meant to be used as interactive elements. Instead use the [Button](/components/Button) component.

<!-- Don't use labels as buttons -->

Position the labels to clearly identify the object they’re informing.

<!-- Position them clearyl -->

Labels can be used in other components, such as [Cards](/components/Card). E.g, using "new" or "recommended" in a group of stacked Cards.

<!-- Use labels in other components -->

### Content

Use label with with short, scannable text. If possible, use a single word to describe the status of an object. Use two or more words if you need to describe a complex state or category. For example, “Limitied availability" or "Enterprise Only".

<!-- Don't use long sized text -->

## Options

### Size

Labels come in three sizes: `small`, `medium`, and `large`.

### Small

Use `small` size for inline text or list items.

### Medium

Use `medium` for medium sized headings introducing a section, or components such as `Card`.

### Large

Use `large` for large headings that introduce a page, like a `Hero` does.

### Color

The label offers color options from the [Primer Brand color palette](/primitives/color). These color choices are carefully curated to ensure optimal contrast with the background or surrounding elements. Colors options doesn't follow a strict functional meaning. We recommend using the colors that best fit the context of your application. E,g. Blue and purple gradient for Copilot examples.

<!-- Examples for the three sizes -->

### Leading visual

You can add a leading icon to enhance the visual context. It is recommended you use an [Octicon](https://primer.style/octicons) here. Use an icon that reinforces the meaning of the label. For example, a `StarIcon` for a "favorite" label.

<!-- Examples for the three sizes -->
