## Anatomy

![An image displaying a Radio with a radio and label.](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/719022fa-4694-42c0-8554-b1923c65739f)

- Radio: A selection control.
- Radio Label: A description for the Radio. 

## Usage

The Radio component enables users to select a single option when used in a grop, making them suitable for scenarios where users are restricted to choosing just one option.

For scenarios that allow for multiple selections, use the Checkbox(/components/Checkbox) component instead. To implement Radio buttons effectively, ensure that each radio button has a clear and concise label associated with it. Maintain consistent styling, including capitalization and without ending punctuation.

If you have a short list of options and want users to select only one, consider using a radio button in a radio group. A radio group is a collection of related radio buttons grouped together. It helps provide clear context and organization for the options.

### States

Radios have static dimensions and three different states when checked or unchecked: rest (default), focus, and disabled.

### Accessibility 

Please use FormControl(/components/FormControl) to render a standard radio input field. If using standalone, it should always be accompanied by a corresponding `<label>` to improve support for assistive technologies.

## Options

### Caption

A caption for a checkbox can be useful in certain scenarios where additional information or clarification is needed for the checkbox option. Some examples include complex or technical options, ambiguous or unclear options, legal or compliance requirements, or accessibility considerations.
