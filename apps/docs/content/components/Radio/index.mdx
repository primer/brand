## Anatomy

![An image displaying a Radio with a radio and label.](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/131988618/1b494cdb-4991-4fc9-beac-feb02b296cb9)

- Radio: A selection control.
- Label: A description for the radio. 

## Usage

Use the radio component to enable users to select a single option from a list.

For scenarios that allow for multiple selections, use the [checkbox](/components/Checkbox) component instead. Keep the radio label descriptive and concise: aim for no more than 3 words. Write labels in sentence case and without ending in punctuation.

### Grouping
Use the `name` prop to group together related radio components in a list.

If you're not building something custom, you should use the `Stack` and `FormControl` component to render a group of radio inputs.

### States

Radios have static dimensions and three different states when checked or unchecked: rest (default), focus, and disabled.

## Options

### Caption

A caption for a radio can be useful in certain scenarios where additional information or clarification is needed for the radio option. Some examples include complex or technical options, ambiguous or unclear options, legal or compliance requirements, or accessibility considerations.

## Accessibility 

Please use [FormControl](/components/FormControl) to render a standard radio input field. If using standalone, it should always be accompanied by a corresponding `<label>` to improve support for assistive technologies.

## Related components

- [Checkbox](/components/Checkbox): Use the checkbox component to select one or more options of a limited number of choices.
- [Select](/components/Select): Use the select component to enable selection of one option from a list.
- [FormControl](/components/FormControl): Use the form control component to display form inputs alongside labels, validation and more.
