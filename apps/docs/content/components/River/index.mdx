## Usage

### Stacked

Two or more rivers can be stacked to walk the user through a set of feautres. When stacking rivers, consider alternating between left and right alignments to create a more dynamic reading flow. When alternating alignements, use a `40:60` image to text ratio, when not, keep the ratio to `50:50`.

Note that too many rivers can make the design feel repetitive, in that situation, consider introducing a breakout section or break the content with a different component, such as [Pillar](/components/Pillar) or [Card](/components/Card) to provide a better visual hierarchy. For example, use the river for the top features you want to highlight and then use Pillars to showcase the rest of the features.

### Body

### Link

River can include an optional call to action. Use it to link to more detailed content about the feature or topic.

### Media

A river can include either an image or video to illustrate the feature or topic. The media should be relevant to the content and should not be used as a decorative element.

Always use high quality images and videos. Avoid using images with text or single logos. Ensure the image fills the provided container.

The image is automatically styled to fit the width of the parent container. If you have bespoke styling requirements, you can disable the provided default styles and style the image manually.
