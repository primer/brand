## Usage

Use the testimonial component to showcase a quote or a review from a customer. Use the testimonials to build credibility, trust, and provide social proof by displaying customers' sentiments about the product.

Testimonials should be short and concise. Avoid using long quotes that can be hard to understand or that don't provide enough context.

Avatars and logos are optional and can be used to provide more context about the customer or the company. When using an avatar, use an image of the customer to make the testimonial more personal and provide more credibility. If an image is not available, use a logo or similar visual that represents the customer company or organization.

Testimonials can be used individually or in a group. When using a group of testimonials, use the same size and alignment for all of them. When including an avatar or a logo, use it in all of them and keep the same style and size, and don't alternate between logos and avatars. We recommend using a maximum of 4 testimonials per group to avoid visual noise and to keep the quotes relevant.

## Options

### Size

The testimonial component uses the small size by default. Use the large size to provide more visual weight.

    <Caption>
      Don't use large size in small sized areas or components like rivers, so
      they don't conflict with the main content, even if the quote is short. Use
      the small size instead.

### Alignment

Testimonials can be aligned to the start or center of the container. Aligning to the start is the default and recommended behavior. Use center alignment only when the overall page design calls for this alignment and the quotes aren't too long to avoid the content from looking too spread out.
