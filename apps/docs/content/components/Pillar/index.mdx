## Anatomy

![An image showing the Pillar anatomy with an icon, a heading and a description in a vertical order.](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/a43841af-3ea8-488d-b948-b8cac82a1b00)

- Icon: An optional visual cue related to the content of the Pillar.
- Heading: The main title of the Pillar. It should be short and concise.
- Description: Short text that extends the information provided by the heading.

## Usage

Use pillars to group similar features or benefits together to easily scan and read. Pillars display content in a familiar and recognizable style.

### Stacked

Pillars should be stacked to display a list of items that are related to each other. Use consistent pillar sizes within a row or group. A group or a row of content pillars is more visually appealing when the widths and heights of all elements match, so keep the content lenght of each pillar consistent.

If displaying an icon, do so for all cards to achieve a visually balanced layout.

When presenting more than four pillars, we recommend displaying them in multiple rows. You can use the [Grid](/components/Grid) or the [Stack](/components/Stack) component to achieve this. We recommend using a grid with 3 or 4 columns and balancing the number of pillars on each row.

### Pillar and Card

Pillar and Card components might lead to ambiguity when deciding which one to use, as both could be used to provide pieces of related and condensed information. Some of the differences between them are:

#### Interaction

Pillars are used mainly for plain content and might include an optional link for extended information. On the other hand, Cards are primarily navigational elements.

#### Hierarchy

Cards should be used for noteworthy information to draw users attention. Pillars, in the other hand, should be used for common, less noticeable information compared to Cards.

#### Group size

Cards should be used in small groups (3, 4 or 5 items maximum) whereas Pillars might be used on both small and big groups (more than 5 items). The more items a users see's within a group, the less noticeable they become as unique elements.

## Options

### Align

Pillars can be aligned to the start or center of the container. Aligning to the start is the default and recommended behavior. Use center alignment only when displaying a maximum of 4 pillars and the overall page design calls for this alignment, so that the content is visually balanced and easy to scan.
