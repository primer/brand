- Icon: It provides a visual cue to the user about the content of the piller. Icon is optional.
- Heading: The main title of the Pillar. It should be short and concise.
- Description: Short text that extends the information provided by the heading.

## Usage

Use pillars to group similar features or benefits together to easily scan and read. Pillars displays content in a familiar and recognizable style.

### Stacked

Pillars should be stacked to display a list of items that are related to each other. Use consistent pillar sizes within a row or group. A group or a row of content pillars is more visually appealing when the widths and heights of all elements match, so keep the content lenght of each pillar consistent.

When presenting numerous pillars, we recommend stacking them vertically. You can use the [Grid](/components/Grid) or the [Stack](/components/Stack) component to achieve this. We recommend using a grid with 3 or 4 columns.

## Options

### Align

Pillars can be aligned to the start or center of the container. Aligning to the start is the default and recommended behavior. Use center alignment when in groups of 3 or 4 pillars and if their title and descriptions are short, so that the content is visually balanced and easy to scan.
