## Usage

Use an unordered list to group related items together. It is suitable for presenting a collection of items that do not require a specific order or ranking. The unordered list provides visual bullet points for each item, which helps to emphasize the individuality of each point and makes it easier for users to scan and comprehend the information.

Use the unordered list to effectively provide a quick reference or highlight key points. This allows users to easily grasp the main ideas or features without having to read lengthy paragraphs.

The unordered list should have conscise and short items. Avoid using long sentences or paragraphs as they can be difficult to scan and comprehend. If you need to include a long item or even headings and links, consider using a [pillar](/components/Pillar), a [card](/components/Card) or a [river](/components/River) instead.

## Options

### Variant

The unordered list uses a dash to indicate each item in the list. The dash is the default variant and is suitable for most use cases. You can use check icons to indicate a list of features or benefits that are supported by the application. This way users can easily check off or easily compare the features that they might be interested in.
