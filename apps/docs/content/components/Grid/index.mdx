## Anatomy

![Lorem ipsum]()

## Usage

Use the grid component to define a layout that maintains consistent element positioning and sizing across pages. The grid component has 12 columns and uses vertical and horizontal gaps to separate content units consistently.

Use the grid to group other components. E.g. A list of [cards](/components/Card) or [pillars](/components/Pillar). Use the same column span for each element to create a consistent layout and spacing.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Use the same column span for each content unit to create a consistent
      layout and spacing. In this example, each card has a column span of 4.
    </Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Don't use different column spans when grouping the same elements with
      similar content.
    </Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Use different column spans when you want to create a visual hierarchy, using different components or the content within a section is not related. E.g. a section with a large image and a few paragraphs of text.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Use different column spans when you want to create a visual hierarchy.
    </Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Don't use equal column spans when the content is not related or the
      components are different.
    </Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Responsive

The grid component provides control of the number of columns that should be displayed at each breakpoint. We recommend using the same column span for each content unit at each breakpoint to create a consistent layout and spacing.

<div>
  <CustomVideoPlayer
    width="100%"
    src="https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/d8e76477-1b27-4be1-9bf5-d22186af8376"
  />
  <Caption>
    Stack cards vertically so that the content has enough line length.
  </Caption>
</div>
