## Usage

Use the grid component to define a layout that maintains consistent element positioning and sizing across pages. The grid is based on a 12-column grid layout and uses vertical and horizontal gaps to separate content units consistently.

Use the grid to group other components. E.g. A list of [cards](/components/Card) or [pillars](/components/Pillar). Use the same column span for each element to create a consistent layout and spacing.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Use the same column span for each content unit to create a consistent
      layout and spacing. In this example, each card has a column span of 4.
    </Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Don't use different column spans when grouping the same elements with
      similar content.
    </Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

In some layouts, you may need certain grid items to span specific amount of columns or rows instead of an even distribution. Use different column spans when you want to create a visual hierarchy, when using different components or when defining top-level layout structures. E.g. a section with a large image and text, a footer with a list of links and a logo or when defining a layout with main content and a sidebar.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Use different column spans when you want to create a visual hierarchy.
    </Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <Caption>
      Don't use equal column spans when the content is not related or the
      components are different.
    </Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Grid vs Stack

We'll use the grid or the [stack](/components/Stack) component depending how the child items are displayed and how are they expected to work on various screen sizes. If the element has all of its child items displayed inline, then most probably the stack component would be the best option. However, if you see columns and rows, then the use the grid component[^1].

#### Grid examples

When defining a top-level page layout. E.g. Using a sidebar, main and navigation areas.

When dividing an area into two areas. E.g. A "contact us" sidebar and a form, and the secondary area uses grid for the form layout itself.

For laying out a card, pillars or text component grid.

#### Stack examples

- Navigation: Page navigation or a list of links should be built with the stack component. E.g. Having a logo on the left side and the navigation on the right.
- Action lists: A group of action or buttons, where items are displayed next to each other, and they are distributed horizontally.
- Form elements: A combination of an input field with a button next to it.
- Profile cards: A combination of a user photo and descriptive content, where the information takes the remaining space from its parent element. This could be applied to any combinations of icon and text.

### Responsive

The grid component provides control over the number of columns that span the elements at each breakpoint. We recommend using the same column span for each content unit at each breakpoint to create a consistent layout and spacing.
For smaller viewports, we recommend to span elements to the 12 available columns.

For example, a group of items that spans 3 columns on a large viewport should span to 4 columns on medium viewports and 6 or 12 columns on small viewports.

<div>
  <CustomVideoPlayer
    width="100%"
    src="https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/a99beba9-b22f-4e2b-a5fa-66c2db246965"
  />
  <Caption>
    Use the same column span for each content unit at each breakpoint to create
    visually consistent layouts.
  </Caption>
</div>

## Accessibility

By default, the grid assumes that it will be used in a purely decorative fashion and thus sets no roles, ARIA attributes, or keyboard shortcuts. This is equivalent to having a sequence of `<div>` elements on the page by default. Any interactive content within the grid should be given an appropriate accessibility treatment based on the specific workflow of your application.
