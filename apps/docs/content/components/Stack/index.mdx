## Usage

Use the stack component to offer space distribution and alignment between items in a vertical or horizontal direction (one-dimensional layout)[^1]. If you need vertical and horizontal layout (two-dimensional layout), use the [grid](/components/Grid) component instead. We recommend reding the [grid vs stack documentation](/components/Grid#grid-vs-stack) documentation.

We recommend using the stack component for inline or text based elements. The stack allows scaling, wraping and shrinking features depending on each item content. For example, a navigational list or a button group.

[^1]: The stack component is implemented using the [CSS Flexbox Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) specification.

## Options

### Gap

Use the gap to change the space between items. Use small values when grouping closed related items, and larger values to separate sections or non-related items between them.
