## Anatomy

![An image displaying a hero with a heading, description, primary and secondary actions.](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/51f3dd23-9ac7-4825-9169-4fb7f295e7f1)

- Heading: the main title of the hero.
- Description: a short description of the hero.
- Actions: the main and secondary actions the user should take on the page.

## Usage

Use the hero component to provide a title, description and action that introduces the main content of a page. The hero component is designed to be positioned at the top of a page and spans the full width of the viewport. Consider using the [CTA banner](/components/CTABanner) to replicate the content and actions in other parts of the page.

Both heading and description of the hero should be short and descriptive. Heading should be not be longer than 2 lines, and description should be no longer than 3-4 lines.

The hero component is not designed to provide a lot of information to the user. Consider using other components, such as the [section intro](/components/SectionIntro) or the [river](/components/River) component instead.

The hero heading is rendered as an `h1` element by default. You can modify the heading level but be aware that this will affect the page's heading structure and may impact accessibility. [See heading accesibility](/components/Heading#accessibility) for more information.

The hero can optionally include primary and secondary actions. These actions are rendered as a [button group](/components/ButtonGroup) and follow the same guidelines as the button group component.

## Options

### Alignment

Hero elements can be aligned to the start or center of the page. By default, the hero is aligned to the start of the page to allow for an image or a visual asset to be positioned on the right of the hero. Use the center alignment if the asset is centered or not present, or the scenario calls for it.

## Accesibility

Centering text may negatively impact legibility making text difficult to read. While we support this variant if possible use the left-aligned design to improve readability for more users.
