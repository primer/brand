<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

The `VideoPlayer` component supports the following keyboard shortcuts for controlling video playback:

- `Space` or `k`: Toggles between playing and pausing the video.
- `m`: Toggles between muting and unmuting the video.
- `f`: Toggles between entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
- `c`: Toggles closed captions on and off.
- `ArrowLeft`: Seeks the video backward by 5 seconds.
- `ArrowRight`: Seeks the video forward by 5 seconds.
- `j`: Seeks the video backward by 10 seconds.
- `l`: Seeks the video forward by 10 seconds.
- `ArrowUp` or `ArrowDown`: Increases or decreases the volume by 10%.
- `0-9`: Seeks the video to a specific percentage of its duration.

These shortcuts closely match what is commonly found in popular video players like YouTube and Vimeo.
