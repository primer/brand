## Options

### Size

Choose the appropriate dimensions for the image to fit the desired layout using the `width/height` or the `aspect-ratio` properties. Avoid using images that are too large or too small for their intended display. When using images in a list, make sure they are all the same size to achieve a visually balanced layout.

## Accessibility

Use the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or for accessibility purposes. It is important to include descriptive alternative text that conveys the meaning or content of the image. For more info, see [alternative text for images](https://primer.style/design/guides/accessibility/alternative-text-for-images).

Optimize your images to reduce file size without compromising quality. Smaller file sizes improve page loading speed.
