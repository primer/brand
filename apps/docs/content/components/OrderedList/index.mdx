## Usage

Use an ordered list to represent a list of items in a numerical order. Each item within the ordered list represents an item that is ordered in a sequence and displays a number to indicate its position in the sequence.

The ordered list is commonly used when presenting sequential or step-by-step information. It is suitable for instructions, procedures, tutorials, or any content that follows a specific order. Ensure that the items in the ordered list are logically organized and follow a clear progression. This helps readers understand the sequence of information and makes it easier to follow.

Avoid overusing ordered lists. Reserve them for situations where the order of items is genuinely meaningful or where a clear sequence needs to be conveyed. For lists that don't require a specific order, consider using an [unordered list](/components/UnorderedList) instead.
