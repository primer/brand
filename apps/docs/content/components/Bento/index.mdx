export default ComponentLayout

As its name suggest this component is inspired by the Japanese bento lunch boxes. Bentos are an assortment of boxes arranged in a neat grid that forms a delightful unit. The intricate and harmonious pairing of contents  makes a successful bento. The idea is to provide the most compelling picture of the product/feature we are presenting by allowing a rich variety of media type to tell and mini story.

## Usage

Use bentos to present complex feature sets that require the presentation of various types of content. Each bento is composed of a minimum of 3 boxes and a maximum of 7-8. Each box should feature a small amount of content to create focus at the box level.

### Boxes

Boxes are the constituent of the bento. Each should focus a clear point by featuring only the relevant content.
Each box should not be narrower than 4 col. We allow full row width boxes as a breakout.
