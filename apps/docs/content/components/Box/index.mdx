## Usage

The box component is a versatile layout component that is intended to simplify the process of adding one-off styles such as padding, margin, background color, and border to (or around) an element.

The box provides convenient and comprehensive access to Primer Brand's underlying Primitives, such as the spacing scale and functional design tokens for color and borders.

While the box component is highly customizable and can be used to create complex layouts, it is important to use it judiciously and only when necessary.

## Options

### Padding

Inner spacing is configurable on all sides or specific directions. Box utilises the CSS padding specification, using logical operators to aid bi-directional reading support.

Additionally, fine-grained control over padding at specific viewports is available to ensure optimal, responsive layout on different screen sizes.

### Margin

Outer spacing is also configurable on all sides or specific directions. Box utilises the CSS margin specification, similarly using logical operators to aid bi-directional reading support.

### Background color

Box enables first-class customisation of its background-color property. Options are limited to background-oriented, functional design tokens such as `default` and `subtle`, to ensure maximum color contrast with foreground text.

### Border

Box offers various border customisations options, including configuration of `border-style`, `border-radius` and `border-colors`.

In most cases, the available options corrospond to border-oriented design tokens available within the system. The exception is border style, which is limited to a subset of the official CSS `border-style` values.

## Accessibility

Box is a purely decorative element by default. It sets no intrinsic roles, ARIA attributes, or keyboard shortcuts.

Any interactive content within a box should be given their own appropriate accessibility treatment based on the specific workflow of your application.
