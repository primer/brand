## Usage

The `RadioGroup` family of components provide a way to group related [Radio](/components/Radio) components together with supporting content such as labels, captions, and validation messages. It creates a semantic fieldset structure that helps maintain proper form hierarchy and accessibility.

> **Important**: When using Radio components within a RadioGroup, ensure you provide the same `name` prop to each Radio. This ensures they are correctly grouped and only one option can be selected at a time.

## Components

### Root

The `RadioGroup` component wraps a group of radio inputs in a `fieldset`.

### Label

The `RadioGroup.Label` component renders as a `legend` and can be used to provide a heading for the group of radio inputs. The label must always be provided for accessibility purposes, but it can be visually hidden.

### Caption

Use `RadioGroup.Caption` to provide additional context or instructions for the group of radio inputs. The caption is automatically associated with the group through ARIA attributes.

### Validation

The `RadioGroup.Validation` component can be used to display success or error messages. It supports two variants:

- `success`: Displays a success message with a check circle icon
- `error`: Displays an error message with an alert icon

## Accessibility

RadioGroup enhances accessibility by:

- Using semantic HTML through the `fieldset` and `legend` elements
- Automatically associating captions and validation messages with the group using `aria-describedby`
- Supporting visually hidden labels that remain accessible to screen readers
- Providing clear visual indicators for validation states with supporting icons
- Ensuring only one option can be selected when radio inputs share the same `name` attribute

Any radio inputs within the group should be given their own appropriate labeling and accessibility attributes.
