## Usage

Use cards to summarize the central idea behind some content and provide a link to its corresponding detailed resource. It is important to present the information in a concise manner, avoiding lengthy and complex descriptions.

Cards should always be used in groups of two or more related concepts.

      Don't use isolated cards. Consider using a CTABanner instead.

### Stacked

Cards should be stacked to display a list of items that are related to each other. If displaying a visual asset, do so for all cards to achieve a visually balanced layout. The visual asset should be the same type for all cards, either an icon or an image.

For a better visual experience, we recommend using similar length size for the heading and description in all stacked cards.

When using an image as the visual asset, we recommend using the same aspect ratio for all images. This will create a more balanced visual experience.

Cards typically appear in groups of three or four in desktop viewports. For smaller viewports, or when more than four cards are needed, we recommend stacking the cards vertically. You can use the [Grid](/components/Grid) or the [Stack](/components/Stack) component to achieve this.

<div>
  <CustomVideoPlayer
    width="100%"
    src="https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/d8e76477-1b27-4be1-9bf5-d22186af8376"
  />

## Anatomy

### Visual asset

The visual asset is optional and can be an image or an icon. It can be used to provide a visual cue to the user about the content of the card. To avoid visual noise, we recommend using only one icon or image, but not both in the same card.

    <Caption>Don't use both icon and image as the visual asset.</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Label

The label can be used to indicate the type of content or its status. For example, use it to indicate that the content is `new` or that it is a `beta` feature. The label is optional and can be used along with a visual asset.

![An image showing two Cards, one with a Label and another one with Label and Icon.](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/2d84fe89-2735-451e-9d1f-9a2f0297e7b5)

### Heading

The heading is the main title of the card. It should be short and concise.

### Description

The description is an optional short text that extends the information provided by the heading.

### Call to action

The call to action label indicates the action or resource the card links to. It defaults to "Learn more".
