## Usage

The Section component is a versatile layout tool. It serves as a container that can be customized to fit various design needs.

Use the Section component to create distinct blocks of related content within a page, enhancing both the structure and the layout. Use it to break up long pages into more digestible segments, making the content more approachable for users.

### Content Grouping

Use the Section component to group related elements together, such as one or more subsections containing text, images, links and other compositions that share a common theme.

### Semantics and headings

The Section component is a semantic element used to create a new section within a page. It should include a heading to title the section. You may use the [section intro component](/components/SectionIntro) or rely top-level components like Hero that already provide the required heading. Ensure that the heading level is appropriate for the content hierarchy.

### Visual Separation

Use different backgrounds and paddings to visually differentiate different sections within a page, aiding in content hierarchy and navigation.

###	Grids and responsive design 

The container maintains content margins and allows the use of the Grid to consistently align elements across different viewport sizes.
