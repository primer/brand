## Themes

<ColorThemePicker />

## Scales

<Note variant="warning">
  Avoid referencing scale variables directly when building UI that needs to
  adapt to different color themes. Instead, use the functional variables. In
  rare cases, you may need to use scale variables to define custom functional
  variables in your application.
