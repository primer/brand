## Anatomy

![Ordered list renders as a numbered list of items](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/912236/5cda0c94-c120-4fc6-8306-8b55012dee0a)

## Usage

Use an ordered list to represent a list of items in a numerical order.

A number indicating the items relative position in the sequence will be prepended to each item in the list.

The ordered list is commonly used when presenting sequential or step-by-step information. It is suitable for instructions, procedures, tutorials, or any content that follows a specific order. Ensure that the items in the ordered list are logically organized and follow a clear progression. This helps readers understand the sequence of information and makes it easier to follow.

Avoid overusing ordered lists. Reserve them for situations where the order of items is genuinely meaningful or where a clear sequence needs to be conveyed. For
lists that don't require a specific order, consider using an [unordered list](/components/UnorderedList) instead.

The ordered list should have concise and short items. Avoid using long sentences or paragraphs as they can be difficult to scan and comprehend. If you need to include a long item or even headings and links, consider using a [pillar](/components/Pillar), a [card](/components/Card) or a [river](/components/River) instead.
