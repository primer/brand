### Patch Changes

- [#104](https://github.com/primer/brand/pull/104) [`b6322de`](https://github.com/primer/brand/commit/b6322de9e5efb336aa6c0e8971c91f5af27029ff) Thanks [@JoshBowdenConcepts](https://github.com/JoshBowdenConcepts)! - Added a subtle variant for button component

* [#106](https://github.com/primer/brand/pull/106) [`85ed4d0`](https://github.com/primer/brand/commit/85ed4d0759b09c174ef25c5b03eaf2154c91830d) Thanks [@rezrah](https://github.com/rezrah)! - Restore font folder to package root

  In `0.5.2` release, the `/fonts` folder was mistakenly placed in `dist/` following the conversion of primer/brand to a monorepo.

  This has now been fixed in `0.5.3` by restoring the folder to package root to preserve backwards compatibility.

- [#102](https://github.com/primer/brand/pull/102) [`7fa82a5`](https://github.com/primer/brand/commit/7fa82a5173193d23cabec1c7b2731aa4bd3c43ef) Thanks [@rezrah](https://github.com/rezrah)! - Added size prop to Heading component for granular control of visual sizing.

  Usage example:

  ```jsx
  <Heading as="h2" size="4">
    This h2 will appear visually identical to a h4
  </Heading>
  ```
