Tooltips in the `VideoPlayer` component now remain briefly visible after the pointer is moved away from the toggle. This small delay improves general usability and helps meet the [WCAG 1.4.13 criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#content-on-hover-or-focus) for accessible hover interactions with tooltips.
