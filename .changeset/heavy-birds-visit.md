    <em>GitHub Codespaces</em> offers a complete dev environment in seconds, so you can code, build, test, and open pull
    requests from any repo anywhere.
  </Timeline.Item>
  <Timeline.Item>
    <em>GitHub Copilot</em> is your AI pair programmer that empowers you to complete tasks 55% faster by turning natural
    language prompts into coding suggestions.
  </Timeline.Item>
