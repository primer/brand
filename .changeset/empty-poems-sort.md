'@primer/react-brand': patch

Updated `SubNav` links and submenus to use `ul` and `li` elements — instead of `div` elements — to communicate the hierarchy of the navigation to assistive technologies. All top-level items are all rendered as `li` elements, and submenus are rendered as `ul` elements with `li` children.
