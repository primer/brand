Updated visual heading hierarchy in the `Prose` component.

- `h3` reduced from `size-500` to `size-400`
- `h4` reduced from `size-400` to `size-300`
- `h5` reduced from `subhead-large` to `subhead-medium`
- `h2` and `h6` are unchanged

This update makes it easier to visually distinguish between `h2` and `h3` elements on the page, which were previously too similar in size.
