`AnchorNav` component updates:

- `AnchorNav.Action` and `AnchorNav.SecondaryAction` now appear visually smaller by default. Use `size="medium"` if the previous, larger buttons are needed.
- `AnchorNav.Action` and `AnchorNav.SecondaryAction` each support a `variant` prop, allowing primary `Button` visuals to be optionally applied.
