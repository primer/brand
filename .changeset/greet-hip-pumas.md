'@primer/react-brand': patch

Updated all instances of `<Text />` in River components to use `muted` color instead of `default` by default, for improved visual hierarchy.

> **Warning**
> This is a visual breaking change to the `River` component. This can lead to reduced contrast in some situations, so please review all usages to ensure minimum contrast requirements are met.
