`River` and `SectionIntro` link colors now default to blue (accent) for consistency with `Card`, `Pillar` and similar components that feature blue links.

:warning: This is a visual breaking change. Please manually review all usages of `River` and `SectionIntro` to ensure there is sufficient contrast with the background color.
