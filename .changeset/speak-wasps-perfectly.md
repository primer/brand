`PricingOptions` now applies the `subtle` background color by default. This is to ensure adequate contrast on a standard `canvas-default` background.

To apply the previous `default` background color (or custom color), you may override a new design token that has been provided for this reason: `--brand-PricingOptions-item-bgColor`.
