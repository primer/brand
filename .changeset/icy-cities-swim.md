'@primer/react-brand': patch
---

Updates to the `SubNav` component:

- Visual overhaul of active states, typography, and narrow viewport menu toggle
- Top and bottom borders now included by default on the container. This may cause double borders if the surrounding layout already applies borders
- ⚠️ `hasShadow` prop is now deprecated. It will be removed in a future release
- `SubNav.Action` default variant changed from `primary` to `accent`
- No breaking API changes
