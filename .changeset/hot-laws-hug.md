`VideoPlayer` accessibility improvements

- Improved contrast of play overlay focus styles.
- Improved contrast of controls and title.
- The title bar now hides while the video is playing.
- The controls bar now hides when the cursor or keyboard focus leaves the video player, or after a few seconds of inactivity, and reappears when the cursor or keyboard focus returns.
